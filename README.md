# Finance & Data Analytics Portfolio

Hi, Iâ€™m Ansar Mukhtar.  
Iâ€™m a finance and data analytics professional with a Masterâ€™s in International Business and hands-on experience in FP&A, controlling, and business analysis. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve built financial models, dashboards, and analysis tools that turn raw data into clear, decision-ready insights.  

This portfolio brings together a selection of my work â€” from budgeting and forecasting to SQL-driven financial reporting â€” to show how I approach real-world business problems.
