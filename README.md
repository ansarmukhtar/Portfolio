My expertise is in building practical, data-driven solutions such as interactive dashboards, driver-based models and SQL powered reports that help businesses monitor performance, forecast outcomes and make informed decisions. With a Masterâ€™s in International Business and hands-on experience across multiple tools and data environments, I focus on turning complex data into clear and actionable insights that support strategic growth.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Budget vs Actuals Dashboard  
**Tools:** Power BI, DAX, Excel, SQL  

This interactive dashboard tracks revenue, costs, and variances by region, business unit, and product category.  
It includes month-over-month trends, variance analysis in both absolute and percentage terms, and gross margin KPIs.  
Users can filter results using dynamic slicers for time periods, regions, and product categories.

This dashboard started from clean CSVs for budget versus actuals and a calendar table. I connected the data on the date column, set correct data types, and wrote simple DAX measures for revenue, COGS, gross margin, and revenue variance versus budget. The visuals show monthly trends, variance by region, and KPI cards that update with slicers for region, business unit, and product category. The result is a quick monthâ€‘end view where variances are easy to spot and discuss in reviews.

### 2. Driver-Based Cash-Flow Model  
**Tools:** Excel (Formulas, Scenario Analysis)  

A 12-month cash-flow forecast that uses growth rates, COGS percentages, and working-capital assumptions such as DSO, DPO, and inventory days.  
It features a scenario sheet that allows changes in sales growth or payment terms to be tested easily, with automatic updates to forecast results.  
The model outputs the monthly net cash position and ending balance.

This model began with a simple historical monthly P&L and key working capital metrics. I built a 12-month forecast driven by growth rate, COGS percentage, and DSO, DPO, and inventory days. Formulas calculate monthly revenue, COGS, operating expenses, changes in receivables, payables, and inventory, and ending cash balance. A scenario sheet allows quick adjustments to drivers so the forecast updates instantly, making it useful for planning different growth and payment-term situations.

### 3. SQL Finance Mart  
**Tools:** SQLite, SQL, Data Modeling  

A small but complete database designed for finance analytics, containing tables for orders, customers, products, and general ledger transactions.  
The project demonstrates producing P&L by month, identifying top customers, and calculating revenue by region, with queries and results that can feed directly into BI tools.
